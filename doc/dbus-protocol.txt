Filenames do not include the subvolume.

Strings are UTF-8. Other characters (e.g. in filenames) must be encoded
hexadecimal as "\x?" or "\x??". As a consequence "\" must be encoded as "\\".

Due to security concerns there are no methods to get, compare or revert
files. This can be done in the client.
