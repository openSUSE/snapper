  <!-- List of solvables. If the zypp commit transaction includes any solvable
       listed below, snapper will create pre and post snapshots. The match
       attribute defines whether the pattern is a Unix shell-style wildcard
       ("w") or a regular expression ("re"). If any of the matching solvables
       is marked as important, the snapshots are also marked as important. -->
